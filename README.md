## Design
- Desktop **960px and above**: Wide screen layout that allows content to be displayed side by side for better readability and give visual balance.
- Tablet **481px to 959px**: Layout adapts by resizing and stacking elements to fit medium-sized screens to allow easy navigation and also allow for the text to be sufficiently readable without too much scrolling.
- Mobile **480px and below**: The layout is fully vertical and responsive, meaning section-wise stacking, image and video resizing, and the other interface buttons are designed large enough to be easily tapped on smaller displays.
- **Gradients**: angled linear gradient `linear-gradient(135deg, #ff0072 36%, #ffa500 100%)` is applied across main backgrounds that create relative visual depth and constitute a unifying element across devices.
- **Color scheme**: consistent use of #ff0072, #ffa500, #fbfbfb, #ff54bb for text, buttons, and backgrounds for brand consistency and readability.
